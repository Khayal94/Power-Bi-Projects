## Project Overview


The objective of this project was to create an interactive dashboard that helps the Toman Bike Share team monitor and analyze key metrics such as hourly revenue, seasonal trends, profit margins, and rider demographics. Using Power BI and Microsoft SQL, I developed a dashboard that provides actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.


### Requirements 

The dashboard meets the following requirements set by the Toman Bike Share team:

Hourly Revenue Analysis: Visualized hourly revenue to identify peak and off-peak times.

Profit and Revenue Trends: Tracked daily and seasonal profit and revenue trends for a comprehensive financial overview.

Seasonal Revenue: Highlighted revenue across different seasons to identify the impact of weather and seasons on rider activity.

Rider Demographics: Provided insights into the types of riders (casual vs. registered) and their behaviors to guide marketing strategies.

 
 # Data Source and Technology Stack
The project used a combination of SQL and Power BI to perform data extraction, transformation, and visualization:



Microsoft SQL Server:
A dataset with rider details and cost tables was accessed using SQL. The key SQL code used to generate the report included:

# Power BI:


Data was visualized in Power BI, using the following components:

Revenue and Profit Analysis: A line chart showing hourly and seasonal changes in revenue and profit.

Seasonal Trends: A slicer to filter data by season, enabling better insight into performance across different timeframes.

Rider Demographics: Pie charts and bar graphs to segment riders based on type (casual or registered) and to compare behaviors.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### Insights and Recommendations

   After analyzing the data, several key insights were discovered:

Hourly Revenue: Peak hours were observed during weekday evenings, with a significant increase in revenue during weekends.

Seasonal Trends: Summer months saw the highest rider activity and revenue, while winter saw the lowest.

Profit Margins: Casual riders contributed significantly to the overall revenue, although registered riders provided more consistent revenue throughout the year.


           
### Recommendation on Pricing for 2024



A 10% increase would set the new price at $5.49.
A 15% increase would raise the price to $5.74.
It is recommended to further segment pricing between casual and registered riders and monitor the impact of these changes on ridership.
 ### Design and Aesthetics
 
 The dashboard was designed using the companyâ€™s color palette to maintain brand consistency. Efforts were made to ensure the layout was intuitive, with clear navigation and interactive filters for a smooth user experience.
         
### Conclusion

This dashboard provides the Toman Bike Share team with critical insights to enhance decision-making around pricing, rider engagement, and seasonal promotions. With the ability to analyze revenue trends in real-time, the company is better equipped to optimize operations and improve profitability.
